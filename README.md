# Monitor Platform Apps
## Project monitoring in the age of the smartphone

This repository contains the source code for Android apps that are the face of the Monitor Platform. The Monitor Platform provides services to organizations and companies that need to monitor the state of geographically dispersed projects, places or anything else on an ongoing basis. MP currently has 2 apps; the Monitor and Staff apps. 

The Monitor app collects project data: gps location, status data and images; this data is stored in a backend database in the cloud and images are stored on Cloudinary's CDN. The Staff app manages a team of Monitors that are assigned to projects and works with the project status data and images collected by the teams.
